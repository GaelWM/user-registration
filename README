# User Registration

## Scenario: User Registration and Email Verification using Saga Pattern and Kafka

Goal: Streamline the user registration process and ensure email verification using the Saga pattern and Kafka messaging system.

Microservices Involved:

1. User Service: Handles user registration and manages user-related data.
2. Email Service: Responsible for sending and verifying email addresses.

Scenario Steps:

1. User Registration:

   - A user initiates the registration process by providing their details on the registration form.
   - The User Service receives the registration request and creates a new user account with a unique user ID.
   - It publishes a UserCreated event to a Kafka topic, containing the user details and the user ID.

2. Email Sending:

   - The Email Service is subscribed to the Kafka topic where UserCreated events are published.
   - Upon receiving a UserCreated event, the Email Service extracts the user's email address from the event and generates an email verification token.
   - The Email Service records the email and the token generated
   - It sends an email to the user's provided email address, including the verification token, and publishes an EmailSent event to another Kafka topic, containing the User ID.

3. Email Verification:
   - The User Service is subscribed to the Kafka topic where EmailSent events are published.
   - Upon receiving an EmailSent event, the User Service starts processing the event.
   - It retrieves the user ID from the event and associates the email verification token with the user account.
   - If the user verifies the email address by clicking on the verification link in the email, the User Service updates the user's email verification status to "Verified" and publishes an EmailVerified event to the Kafka topic, containing the user Email.
   - If the email verification fails (e.g., expired token or invalid link), the User Service can publish an EmailVerificationFailed event to the Kafka topic, indicating the failure and taking appropriate actions.

## Prerequisites

Before running this Docker Compose configuration, ensure that you have Docker and Docker Compose installed on your system.

## Project Setup

- Clone the repo `git clone https://github.com/GaelWM/user-registration.git`
- Open your terminal, on the root of the project run `docker-compose build  & docker-compose up`
- Wait for about 30 seconds to a minute for all services to be up
- Double check that all services are up, if not restart them

# Project UI tools:

This helps managing all your activities with a graphical user interface.

- Confluent Control Center: http://localhost:9021
- User Service: http://localhost:3000
- Email Service: http://localhost:4000
- Mongo Express (User): http://localhost:8081
- Mongo Express (Email): http://localhost:8082
- MailHog Web Interface: http://localhost:8025

Feel free to adjust the exposed ports or modify the configuration based on your specific needs.

# How to test

The project exposes 4 endpoints

1.  http::localhost:3000/auth/sign-up -> helps to sign up a user by passing (name, email, password)
2.  http::localhost:3000/auth/auth/verify-user --> helps verify the user after this one has clicked on the link sent by email
3.  http::localhost:3000/ --> help list all users
4.  http::localhost:4000/ --> Helps list all emails & token

5.  Find the postman export of apis endpoints in the root of the folder
6.  Import the file to postman
7.  And you should see 3 apis where the signUp is really the main one
8.  Go on add your details in the body and click on Send button
9.  You should get either two responses "User created successfully or User Already Exists"
10. Now that you did that,
11. Open Confluent Control Center on http://localhost:9021 and go on topics you should be able to see two events
    One UserCreated event and another EmailSent, you can check the details of the message
12. On success of this message an email should be sent to the default account of mailhog
13. Open Mailhog on http://localhost:8025, you should be able to see an email with the link and click on the link to verify the user
14. After doing so, go back to Confluent Control Center on http://localhost:9021, you now be able to see EmailVerified event being sent.
15. Check the details of the message.

## Notes

- There are images attached to see what to expect as results under images directory in the root of the project.
